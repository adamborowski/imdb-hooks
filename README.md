# Movie Explorer
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Installation guide

First you need to have node >= 8 installed.
Then type in terminal `npm install`
Then you need to obtain an api key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api).
Once you have it, set proper environment variable REACT_APP_DB_API_KEY

# Initial decisions

Due to [lack of person search feature](https://github.com/omdbapi/OMDb-API/issues/37) I've decided to use TMDB instead of OMDB.

The overall architecture of the application is similar to one I developed in Nordea and was adopted by some other teams.

## Tech stack

Despite the scope of the task is relatively small, I've chosen some solutions that scale, just for demonstration purposes.

## feature-first structure

Despite the simplicity of this application I've decided to put whole code into one feature just to show my intention to grow the application.
A feature is a directory which groups all types of modules related to one business case.
For example, movie browser is one feature and user profile is another.
Each feature should be encapsulated and there are no imports between modules from different features. The only exception is the call of redux action and route factories from routing.ts
The code which is reusable, is placed under common directory.

Features are integrated with the appliaction by plugins. A plugin is just a exported unit which is read in some pluggable area (root reducer, main router switch, etc)

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
